# Week 3 assignment

_Python Bootcamp for Data Week 3 assignment_

This week, you learned the basics of Python testing. From a brief overview of the standard library to using a more modern approach with Pytest, one of the most popular testing libraries in Python. You'll use that knowledge to complete the assignment in this repository, where you'll write tests, fix broken tests, and debug issues in real-world code.

> ðŸ’¡ This template repository is made for GitHub Classroom delivery, but can be used independently if you want to learn on your own.

## Assignment instructions

This repository uses automated grading (or testing). When starting, all automated tests will fail. Your task is to make them all pass.

1. Go to the [tests](./tests) directory and fix the [invalid.py](./tests/invalid.py) so that Pytest automatically collects it.
1. Update the three tests inside [invalid.py](./tests/invalid.py) so that Pytest can run them.
1. Go to the [tests/test_util.py](./tests/test_util.py) test file and fix the three tests that aren't passing.
1. Repeat the fix/push/verify cycle until all tests are passing and the [actions](/../../actions) tab shows a green.

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the GitHub Classroom setup, you might get an automated Pull Request created for direct feedback by your Professor or by the TAs.
